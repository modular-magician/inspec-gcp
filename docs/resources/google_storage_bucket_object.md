## Syntax
A `google_storage_bucket_object` is used to test a Google BucketObject resource

## Examples
```
describe google_storage_bucket_object(bucket: 'bucket-with-object', object: 'image1') do
  it { should exist }
  its('size.to_i') { should be > 0 }

  its('time_created') { should be > Time.now - 60*60*24*10 }
  its('time_updated') { should be > Time.now - 60*60*24*10 }
end

describe google_storage_bucket_object(bucket: 'bucket-with-object', object: "nonexistent") do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```

## Properties
Properties that can be accessed from the `google_storage_bucket_object` resource:


  * `bucket`: The name of the bucket.

  * `object`: The name of the object.

  * `content_type`: The Content-Type of the object data.

  * `crc32c`: CRC32c checksum.

  * `etag`: The object entity tag.

  * `generation`: The content generation of this object. Used for object versioning.

  * `id`: The ID of the object, including the bucket name, object name, and generation number.

  * `md5_hash`: MD5 hash of the data; encoded using base64.

  * `media_link`: Media download link.

  * `metageneration`: The version of the metadata for this object at this generation. Used for preconditions and for detecting changes in metadata. A metageneration number is only meaningful in the context of a particular generation of a particular object.

  * `name`: The name of the object.

  * `size`: Content-Length of the data in bytes.

  * `storage_class`: Storage class of the object.

  * `time_created`: The time this object was created.

  * `time_deleted`: The time this object was deleted. Returned if and only if this version of the object is no longer a live version, but remains in the bucket as a noncurrent version.

  * `time_storage_class_updated`: The time at which the object's storage class was last changed.

  * `time_updated`: The modification time of the object metadata.
